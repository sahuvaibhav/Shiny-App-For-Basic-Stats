Stats

Shiny App on Stats

I have created this app on ShinyR. https://sahuvaibhav.shinyapps.io/Stats/

This application is for performing various statistical techniques like Hypothesis Testing, Z-Test, t-Test, Hypothesis Test on two populations  - independent populations, Pooled sample test, unpooled sample test, Paired sample tests, Analysis or Variance(one-way, n-way) and multivariate Analysis of variance.

For better understanding follow my blog - http://analytix-blog.blogspot.in/

I will be adding more functionality]ies in future like regression, multivariate regression, logistics regression, clustering, factoring etc.
